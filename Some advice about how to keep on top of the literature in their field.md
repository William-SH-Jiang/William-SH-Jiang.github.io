#### Some advice I give my graduate students about how to keep on top of the literature in their field

--- Mert R.Sabuncu 

It's good to have a dedicated time (1 hour day?) for finding papers, adding them to your read pile and "processing" them.

For finding papers my go-to tool is Google scholar. I try keyword searches, following citations, and author-based searches. I will also add random papers encounter, say on Twitter, to my stack.

Each paper added to a stack will be prioritized based on a quick skim of the title and abstract level 0 understanding. I recommend a 3-stage prioritization. High, medium, low. High, for instance, will indicate a paper that is super relevant to my project.

You can aim to add and categorize ~10 papers a day. That should not take more than 10 minutes. Next, you move on to level 1 processing of your stackstarting from high priority papers. This level of processing should take about 10 minutes per paper and yield a basic understanding of the algorithm/ model, problem, and data. The inputs and outputs, some modeling details, the literature context (what gap is being filled) will be part of this understanding. You can aim to process ~3 papers/day at this level

I recommend taking notes for level1 processing: 3-4 sentences per paper and
linking these to pdf and paper stack. Next up is level 2 processing, which can take 1-2 hours per paper. You can aim to do ~2-3 papers a week at this level dedicating maybe 30 min/day to this task.

You can only decide if a paper should be level 2, after processing it at level 1 and based on how relevant/important it is for your project. Level 2 processing should lead to a good understanding of the theoretical and empirical details, and results.

Finally we have level 3 processing, where the aim can be replication or baselining. This entails an understanding that allows implementing the algorithm, deriving the theoretical results, and achieving the empirical results. You can probably do 1-2 of these a month.

And the time you spend on this beyond the level 2 understanding can be considered as part of your research time (so not just literature review).

For a given project (paper), you might need to process 100s of papers at level 1, dozens of papers at level 2, and 5-10 at level 3.

These recommendations and estimates are all subject and proiect-specific of course and should only be considered as rough guidelines. Moreover, it does not consider the broad reading that one should also pursue during their PhD and beyond.

That said, I strongly recommend having a system for processing the literature at a steady pace and not simply reactively. This habit can save a lot headache and improve the quality of your work. Fin.
